Build packages using Docker?
RPM can be built locally
.deb should be built through a ppa

# Need devscripts
# Need debhelper
# Need python-stdeb - NO ->> stdeb from packages doesn't do it because it's too old (no changes)
# Need to sign the archive

# python-setuptools-git doesn't need to be in the build-depends, right?

# Need to figure out how we make setuptools_git be installed when building a RPM
#
# Multiple suites?
# Arch?
#

multiple orig.tar.gz --> fix
copy ? hash might mismatch
